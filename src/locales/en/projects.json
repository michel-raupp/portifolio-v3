  "projectImageAlt1": "Image of the 2D Navigation Website project. The image shows an RPG-style map scene with a character in focus.",
  "projectDescription1": "I wanted to test a 2D navigation system similar to an RPG, with collisions and navigation between maps, but without using game-focused libraries or canvas.

  "projectName2": "Radiant Lobby",
  "projectImageAlt2": "Image of the Radiant Lobby project",
  "projectDescription2": "The idea was to study API requests to create a website about elements from the game Valorant. The site features a basic login system with Firebase, allowing users to favorite skins and game items linked to their account. The site was built using React with Next.js and Styled Components.",
  "projectLessons2": "Poorly designed components, lack of pagination and search system, poor performance due to complex animations, lack of internationalization.",
  "projectName3": "Luigi's Pizzeria",
  "projectImageAlt3": "Image of the Luigi's Pizzeria project. The image has a green background, featuring Luigi from the Mario Bros game holding a pizza.",
